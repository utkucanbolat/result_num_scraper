The code is written to track the popularity of the crypto coins from a given list of coin names. The model assumes that the number of Google search results is related to the popularity and, likewise, the trade volume of a coin. For instance, if a coin gets more attention, the number of Google searches that includes its name increases because more people want to follow the news, latest trends, etc., for that coin. From the time-series data of the number of search results, one may estimate the future trends for the coin. This code searches coin names on Google, scrapes the number of search results, and saves the results in a csv file.
